Binary Serach
=============
-> If array is sorted then try to use binary search.
-> Simple binary search pattern for most of the problems is if the element
   is smaller than the target search in left half and if greater then search
   in right half.

   int[] arr = new int[] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}; int target = 7;

   int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1

   int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;

   if (arr[mid] == target) {
       return mid;
   } else if (arr[mid] < target) {
       left = mid + 1;
   } else {
       right = mid - 1;
   }

Sorted Rotated Array
====================
Ex: [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 1, 2, 3]

-> If array is rotated then from the middle one half is sorted and other half is un-sorted
